# Stroustrup_Programming-Principles-and-Practice-Using-Cplusplus



08/01/2018
This is the C++ book I am currently working through.  I want to begin uploading my content to develop a portfolio for employers to see. I am starting on Chapter 4 because this is where Stroustrup begins to talk about selection, iteration, and functions. I feel this is a good place to start showing my basic knowledge.  Chapters 1-3 have been read and completed up to this point.
